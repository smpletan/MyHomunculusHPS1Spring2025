It's a fairly simple process. It's one you've done plenty of times before.
There are a few ingredients you need. The heart to beat, the flesh to hold, the eyes to witness, and the spark of life.
Lay out the flesh.
Place down the heart.
Bundle the heart, and plop on the eyes.
There comes the spark...
...And life is born.
Cognition floods in, but understanding doesn't follow. That's where you come in.
Try to do it right this time.
