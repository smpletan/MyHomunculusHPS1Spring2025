Oh jeez. Uh oh. Oops. Uhhh oh. Ohhhh no. Awww jeez.
Look, I thought our endings accounted for a solid amount of playthroughs. I THOUGHT I figured the numbers out tightly enough.
Obviously I was wrong! So, if you're seeing this - or, god forbid, you're STREAMING or UPLOADING this somewhere, uh.
Look, I'm really sorry, okay? There are a lot of endings. We're still working on it.
Just, um. Pretend this is the 'True Ending.' Haha.
Thanks for playing. We really appreciate it.
