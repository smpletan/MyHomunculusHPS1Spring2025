It's Spring Cleaning day. The season may not necessarily be spring, but each year the town of Hogsden picks an arbitrary day where everyone should clean up their houses.

The state of your home might mean it won't enjoy this time-honored tradition, but who knows what you might have lying around that you can just pawn off?
