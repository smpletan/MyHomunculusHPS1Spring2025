Hogsden's local auditorium is holding a lengthy Film Festival today, and all film buffs in the region are morally obligated to attend.
In order to participate, every prospective film buff needs to pitch in some Jingles to help fund and maintain the town's local videotape archive.
Videotapes, or VHS Tapes, are of course the only viable form of media storage according to GorLabs Compliance Records, and no other format exists to store your favorite movies and videos.
